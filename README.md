Instructions on how to make animated holiday cards from OpenGL shaders.

## Background

For the past years, I've participated in the Demoscene Holiday Card Exchange
([2020](https://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=11998),
[2021](https://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=12205),
[2022](https://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=12374)). I made animated cards, in
the spirit of over head projector effects. If you don't know what that means,
see for example: [Shapes by Cortex](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=53773).

The basic mechanism in all years was the same. The card consists of a
background, printed on a white paper, and a foreground, printed on a transparent
film and cut to the shape of a circle. The foreground is mostly black, with some
transparent areas. A hole is punched in the middle of both the background and
the foreground, and they are attached using a brass fastener. This allows the
foreground to be rotated 360 degrees. As the foreground is rotated, it reveals
different parts of the background, creating an animation. In particular, this
can be used make type of [barrier-grid
animations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier-grid_animation_and_stereography),
with a spiral shaped barrier. These are also sometimes known as scanimations or
Moir√© animations.

The designs were prototyped with [Shadertoy](https://shadertoy.com/),
exported as JPG with Python, printed using a laser printer on paper and
on film, and finally assembled onto a cardboard backing.

## Materials and tools needed

1. **Transparent film, suitable for printing.** I printed using a laser
   printer, and laser printers require the use of dedicated films that
   can withstand the heat without warping and shrinking. Furthermore,
   there's both monochrome laser and color laser transparencies, which
   apperently have slightly different coatings. My designs only used
   grayscale foregrounds, so monochrome laser transparencies were ok. I
   used "Lyreco Transparency film for monochrome laser printer",
   material: PET, size: A4.
2. **Brass fasteners.** I used brass fasteners (split pins), with a
   width of ~ 3 mm.
3. **Cardboard.** Each card requires a 15 cm x 45 cm rectangle. I used
   50 cm x 65 cm 240 g/m^2 cardboard sheets from Canson. Thus, from each
   sheet, I got 4 cards. I preferred dark cardboard (black,
   ultramarine), because the animation will be quite dark, due to
   majority of the foreground being black.
4. **Spray adhesive.** I used Maston 500 ml Spray Adhesive. Not all of
   them are equal: some cheaper brands created awful clumps and did not
   spray evenly.
5. **Super glue.** I used Loctite 5g Precision. Some of the cheap stuff
   I tested didn't actually glue anything, so go with Loctite if you
   want to be sure that the glue works.
6. **Hole punch.** This should match the size of the brass fasteners.
   Mine were 3 mm, so I used a 3 mm punch. Note that it needs to reach
   the center of the film and the paper, so it needs to be one of the
   type shown in the photograph. The ones that only reach a few cm from
   the edge of the paper cannot be used.
7. **Precision cutting knife**. X-acto or similar.
8. **Compass**. The tool for drawing circles, not the device for finding
   the magnetic north.
9. **Paper cutting board**. Preferably with one dimension over 45 cm and a
   grid.
10. **White paper**.
11. **Newspaper or similar**. On which one can apply the spray adhesive.
12. **Disposable gloves**. The spray adhesive and superglue are kinda
    nasty on fingers, so use these when applying the adhesives.
13. **Scissors**.

## Making the animation as a OpenGL shader

The OpenGL shader should output both the background (paper print) and
the foreground (film print). The 2021 card was designed as follows:
first, I wrote a general shader effect in Shadertoy and making sure that
it loops with a period of t = 1. Shadertoy gives the time in a uniform
called iTime. So the looping animation can be put in a function
`vec3 animation(vec2 uv,float t)` which takes the screen coordinates and
time as parameters and outputs an RGB color.

The foreground will be a 16-armed spiral with 50 rings from center to
edge, with majority of it being black and 30% will be transparent
(white). For each pixel we can calculate "phase", with something like
`phase = mod(16*atan2(y,x)/(2*pi)+50*length(vec2(x,y)),1)` and in the
foreground, if `phase < 0.3`, then the pixel is white, otherwise it is
black. The spiral loops after it is turned 1/16th circle, so in the
final card, the animation starts looping after the foreground is turned
1/16th circle.

The background print is now simply produced by
`pixelcolor = animation(uv,phase)`, where phase is calculated using the
same equation as in the foreground and the animation was the original
animation. Note that due to the duty cycle of the foreground being 30%,
at every instance we see not only the current slice t of the animation,
but all colors in a time range of [t,t - 0.3]. So there will be significant
"motion blur". You can decrease the duty cycle to make the animation
sharper, but this will also make the whole animation darker, so you may
want to experiment here to get the results you want.

The background should include some cutting aides, to cut it into a
square. Also, both the foreground and the background should include a
circle in the center, to indicate where the hole should be punched. In
my case, a 3 mm circle.

Finally, due to alignment errors in the final card, the effect tends to
break near the middle and to work better on the edges. Thus, effects
with darkness in the middle (tunnels, starfields) seem to work the best.

An example of a tunnel effect (the 2021 holiday card) is
[here](tunnel.frag); a ShaderToy online version is
[here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NtKGWh).

Another example of an effect with rotating gears (the 2022 holiday card) is
[here](gears.frag); a ShaderToy online version is
[here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/DssSDS).

## Exporting the designs as JPGs using Python

I used poetry to manage dependencies and to setup a virtual environment,
so here goes:

```
poetry install
poetry run python card.py shader.frag
```

This will export background.jpg and foreground.jpg, with nominal sizes
of 14.5 cm x 14.5 cm in 8192 x 8192 resolution.

Try `poetry run python card.py --help` for more export options.

Note that the foreground design will be *mirrored*: we want the printed
side of the film facing directly against the printed side of the paper.
I included some small and large circle in the design allowing figuring
out which side is which; otherwise it's a bit tough to see from the
film.

To actually print the designs on Windows, to my shock I discovered that
of the default Windows software, Paint had the best control of the final
dimensions of the print. It even read the DPI correctly, so if you do
Page Setup before printing (File -> Print -> Page Setup), you can make
the final print centered on paper and exactly 14.5 cm x 14.5 cm.

## Making the card

1. Cut a 15 cm x 45 cm rectangle from the cardboard.
2. With the backside of the knife, score the cardboard, splitting the
   cardboard into a 151 mm, 150 mm and a 149 mm section. We'll call
   these the left, middle, and right sections. Then flip the cardboard
   over, so the scored side is down.
3. Fold the right section to the center, then the left section on top.
   The scored side should be the outside of the folds. Then unfold both
   sections again.
4. Mark the center of the right section. This is done by drawing two
   lines corner to corner.
5. Use a compass to draw a 130 mm circle centered on the center mark.
   The drawing should be inside, so it will not be visible in the final
   card.
6. Carefully cut out the circle, using the knife.
7. Cut the background print into a 14.5 mm x 14.5 mm square. You can use
   scissors here; this cut is not super critical.
8. Place the background print on newspaper, face down, and spray it with
   the spray adhesive. Do this outdoors; the spray adhesive smells bad.
   Use gloves.
9. Attach the background print to the middle of the center section.
   There should be 2.5 mm tolerance on each side.
10. Cut the foreground print into a 14 cm circle. Use the symbols on the
    film to figure which side of the film is which; we want the printed
    side of the film facing directly against the printed side of the
    paper.
11. Punch the centers of both the background (with cardboard backing)
    and the foreground. Try to hit the center as close as possible; if
    it's misaligned, the animation will wobble.
12. Use a brass fastener to attach the foreground to the background.
13. Place a drop of super glue into each of the four corners of the
    middle section, then fold the right section on top.
14. Cut a 13 cm x 13 cm square from white paper.
15. Spray the paper square with spray adhesive as before.
16. Adhere the white square to the left section.
